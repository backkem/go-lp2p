# Example data-channel

This example demonstrates the LP2PQuicTransport API for transmitting data.

The example simulates both peers. It is configured to run in
a non-interactive way, simulating user input.

## Example output

```
The presenting browser (receiver) shows a pin:
Pin: 1234 (presented to user)
The consuming browser (requester) asks the user to enter the pin:
Pin: 1234 (entered by user)
Receiver: got transport
Requester: Received: Good day to you, receiver!
```
